# CSE-612-Software-Development
A real-time project developed for the course "Software Development" (CSE 812) by me and my mate Shovon Das Chowdhury. This system manages departmental activities with a front-end built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, and a back-end powered by Python, Django, jQuery, and SQLite. Project supervised by Nayan Kumar Nath, Lecturer, Department of CSE.
